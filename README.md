# Jenkins Spark Message Plugin

spark-message-plugin is a plugin for Jenkins that allows users to message Spark Rooms when a build starts, succeeds or fails.
It is configurable for custom messages and adding build URLs to the message. The plugin also allows users to add Machine Accounts to rooms as an extra tool. Requires a working Machine Account on Spark, and a Basic Auth token for the Cisco idbroker.
